The idea of the files in this directory is creating a multisystem flowchart to guide the user 
across the platform using visual and interactive resources.
The structure of the json files are based on web objects:
{
    "type" : the web type object (page, button, label),
    "id" : objective identification,
    "name" : object name,
    "desc" : object description,
    "child" : object child (other nodes of the diagram)
}
